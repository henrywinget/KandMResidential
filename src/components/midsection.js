                    While our goal is to provide permanent supported housing fully customized to an individual’s needs, it really begins with relationships.  It’s not just about brick and mortar.  It’s about providing the “scaffolding” for abundant life, which includes rich relationships in a safe environment where each person is loved and valued.  It means being a “family member” with a House Mom and House Sisters, or House Dad and House Brothers.

                  <p className="subtitle is-size-5 about-me-content">
                  Becka’s House  is the first K&M House that opened on June 1, 2019. The vision for Becka’s House created opportunities for a House Family consisting of three House Sisters and one House Mom.
                  </p>
                  <p className="subtitle is-size-5 about-me-content">
                  The need started with Becka, who was graduating from the Experiences in Transition (EXIT) Program at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (TSBVI)  and moving out of a supported dorm environment where she had lived for four years.  Identifying Becka’s need to continue living independently with support to live her most abundant, meaningful life with the skills and abilities she obtained from TSBVI, K&M networked and searched, finding our wonderful House Mom who moved in to the Becka’s House on May 1, one month before Becka’s graduation and transition into the home.
                  </p>
                  <p className="subtitle is-size-5 about-me-content point-maker">
                    We understand the importance for our House Parent to feel perfectly comfortable and settled into the home before the House Sisters or House Brothers move in.
                  </p>
                  <p className="subtitle is-size-5 about-me-content">
                  Becka moved in on June 1 but spent a couple of weekends in the house during the month of May to get familiar with her place of residence before her official move-in date.  We met McKenzie, House Sister #2, in May, and she began regular visits to the house to develop relationships with Becka and our House Mom in June.
                  </p>
                  <p className="subtitle is-size-5 about-me-content">
                  Through frequent visits, outings within the community and meals shared together, we made a combined family decision (McKenzie’s immediate family, Becka’s immediate family and our House Mom) that McKenzie was indeed a perfect fit!  McKenzie moved into Becka’s House in July.
                  </p>
                  <p className="subtitle is-size-5 about-me-content">
                    House Sister #3 has not yet been identified however we are cultivating and growing relationships with several young adult ladies who visit and share fun experiences and community outings with our two House Sisters and House Mom.
                  </p>
                  <p className="subtitle is-size-5 about-me-content">
                  While these friendships continue to grow and flourish, we are confident that God will reveal our final House Sister destined to be an integral member of the dynamic sisterhood created at Becka’s House.
